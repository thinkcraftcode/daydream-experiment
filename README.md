# Daydream Experiment

<b>What is it?</b>

"DreamDraw" is a android VR app for the purpose of exploring the Pixel Phone, Daydream VR platform and the Daydream controller. It allows multiple people  to draw on posted notes in a shared virtual environment as well as use speech to text to generate notes for ideation. 


<b>Disclaimer!</b>

It was unclear if we ever wanted to share the source code or build a real product out of it so expect it to be glued together but some hacky, uncommented messy code that does not follow ustwo coding guidlines or any coding general best practices for that matter. 

As this is purely an experiment, a lot of issues are not resolved and there was very little user
testing.  There is for instance, no room selection option which means that you will connect with anyone around the world who happens to be using the app at the same time.

<b> How to use the app<b>
When you launch the app, it will handle all the networking automatically. You can create a new posted note by swiping your thumb towards yourself(down). Once a new posted not is created, it will fly close to you and enter "edit mode". While the note is close to you, you can draw on it with one of the pen tools or add text to it using the microphone tool. All tools (pens and mic) are used by pushing down on the touch pad which we call the "use" button.  

Once you are done editing a note, you can "commit" it to the wall by swiping away from yourselves (up) and the not will fly back to the wall. At any time you can edit the note again by pointing at it and swiping down or create a new note by pointing at empty space and swiping down. 

To switch between tools, simply tilt your head down as if you wanted to look at your belt line. This action turns the menu on, to select an item of the menu point at it and push down on the "use" button. 

Note: It is possible for up to 6 people to be in the same virtual space (untested). The 7th would end up in a new room. (untested)
